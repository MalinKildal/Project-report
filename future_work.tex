\section{Future Work} \label{future_work}

Future work to develop the method described further is to get a better depthmap image in the first place. The most likely way of achieving this is by testing different lightning conditions. During this study the only light available only had one brightness level. Opportunity of controlling the brightness levels would probably give better results. 

The depthmap achieved through OpenCV should also be aligned with the calibration info and depth data stored in the .ray file produced by the Raytrix software. This information would give the opportunity to run the depthmap directly through the volume algorithm and get concrete numbered results that can be verified.

The next step after getting the actual volume measurement achieved would be to try the system in open sea. This would give more real conditions and if it works properly if would really speed the process of accomplishing a complete system.
