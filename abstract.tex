This report discusses some problems faced by the aquaculture industry, most aimed at salmon breeding. The focus problem in this report is volume measurement of underwater objects using plenoptic camera technology. The object in focus is Atlantic salmon and the camera technology investigated is Raytrix. 

The main focus of this study is making the depthmap images, produced by the Raytrix, more complete so it can be used to make a more accurate volume measurement. This includes attaining the optimal light settings, removal of particle noise, extracting irrelevant and relevant data, and replace missing data with more optimal data.

The supplied method is achieved through the use of image processing in OpenCV. The method removes unwanted depth levels, finds the largest contour, uses this as a mask and fills missing data spots with surrounding adequate data. The results from this method is a depthmap image with far less disturbing elements, and with one main object where the depth data is evened out.
