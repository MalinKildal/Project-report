\begin{abstract}

I would first like to thank my adviser Associate Professor Annette Stahl of the Department of Engineering Cybernetics at NTNU, for her knowledge, great communication and fast response.

I would also like to thank Sensomar AS (SEALAB OCEAN GROUP) for the collaboration. They have provided all equipment needed, provided help for image taking and let us students use their test facility. Also, thanks for serving perfect wiener sausage every Friday.

At last, I would like to thank Marine Harvest for delivering salmon (dead and alive) for testing.
